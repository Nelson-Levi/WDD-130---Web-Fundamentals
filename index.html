        <p>Hi, my name is Levi Nelson! I am from Burley, Idaho, which is a little town about two hours away. Burley isn't nearly as cold or snowy as Rexburg!</p>
        <p> I am a Software Engineering major at BYU-Idaho. I am hoping to become a software engineer one day. I enjoy programming and working with computers. I am really fascinated by what I am learning in college! </p>
        <p>I am a big Super Smash Bros player. I visit many tournaments and play with other players to hone my skills and try to win! I also enjoy fishing, especially in the Snake River. The biggest fish I have ever caught were all in Idaho rivers! I usually fish for smallmouth bass and rainbow trout. </p>
        <p>I have five siblings, and I am the uncle to 11 nieces and nephews. I love to visit my big family, especially for Sunday dinner!</p>
