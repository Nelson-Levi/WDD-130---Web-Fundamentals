            Fish are aquatic, vertebrate animals commonly found throughout the
            world. They are best known for their gills, fins, and streamlined
            bodies, designed perfectly for swimming. Using their gills, fish are
            able to extract oxygen from the water they live in. Fish are
            cold-blooded, which allows them to thrive in diverse habitats, as
            their body temperature adjusts to constantly match their
            surroundings. Fish are covered in scales, which protects their body
            from friction underwater and protects their delicate skin.
          </p>

            Idaho has a high variety of fish species. Anglers from around the
            world visit Idaho to enjoy its rich recreational fishing
            opportunities. Idaho boasts numerous freshwater rivers, lakes, and
            streams, which support important populations of both native species,
            including bull trout and steelhead, and introduced game fish, such
            as rainbow trout. Idaho is also known for its serious efforts in
            conservation, aimed at protecting endangered species, such as
            cutthroat trout and sockeye salmon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Idaho's diverse aquatic ecosystems provide habitats for
            a wide range of fish species, offering anglers an array of fishing
            experiences throughout the state. From the rugged mountain streams
            of the Sawtooth Range to the expansive reservoirs like Lake Pend
            Oreille, Idaho's waters cater to anglers of all skill levels and
            preferences. Whether fly fishing for native cutthroat trout in
            remote backcountry streams or trolling for trophy kokanee salmon in
            the larger lakes, Idaho offers something for every angler's taste.
