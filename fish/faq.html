      <button class="accordion" id="top_button">
        What are the most common fish species found in Idaho waters?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The most common fish species found in Idaho include trout, such as
          brook and rainbow trout, bass species such as largemouth and
          smallmouth bass, grass and common carp, and mountain whitefish.
          Different locations will contain different populations of fish
          species. You can find what fish populate what regions by consulting
          the Idaho Fish and Game.

      <button class="accordion">
        What are some popular fishing destinations in Idaho?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Idaho is known for its wide variety of freshwater fishing
          destinations. Henry’s Lake is known for its trophy trout fishing, and
          is also one of the only spots in Idaho where you can catch the coveted
          cutthroat trout. The Snake River is famous for its prolific insect
          hatches and fantastic fly fishing opportunities. Additionally, be sure
          to check out Priest Lake in northern Idaho, and do your best to land a
          giant mackinaw or kokanee salmon.

      <button class="accordion">
        Can you fish year-round in Idaho, or are there specific seasons?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Fishing is generally allowed year-round in Idaho. While certain
          regulations may apply to specific fish species, waters, and methods,
          most bodies of water are open for recreational fishing any time of
          year. Anglers should always consult the regulations provided by the
          Idaho Department of Fish and Game to ensure they follow all
          regulations where they intend to fish.

      <button class="accordion">
        What unique challenges are facing fish populations in Idaho?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Human activities such as land development have led to the loss of
          critical fish habitiats, including migration paths and spawning areas.
          Additionally, pollution from agricultural runoff and industrial
          discharge have heavily tainted Idaho’s waterways. Invasive species
          such as the tiger mussel have wreaked havoc on natural populations and
          outcompete for food and space. Idaho environmentalists must take
          action to maintain an ecological balance!
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">
        How can I obtain an Idaho fishing license?
      </button>
      <div class="panel" id="bottom_panel">
        <p>
          Fishing licenses can be purchased online from the Fish and Game
          website or an authorized license vendor. Make sure to purchase the
          best kind of fishing license that suits your needs, whether that be an
          annual license, hunting and fishing combo, or short-term license. You
          will need to provide your social security number. After paying the
          fee, you will receive your fishing license either electronically or
          printed physically.
